## Summary

This is a project I built for SDMM with the intent of getting more practice with the React library. I enjoyed this project because although I would say I have a decent grasp on the fundamentals of writing clean and maintainable code, projects built with libraries and frameworks typically have conventions of their own in addition to learning how to integrate them into your own projects. While building out components with React, I also implemented some data persistence with the localStorage property of the Window interface to manage all expense items.
